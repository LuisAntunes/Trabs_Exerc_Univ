  abstract = {Oddly enough, big data was a serious problem just a few years ago. When data volumes started skyrocketing in the early 2000s, storage and CPU technologies were overwhelmed by the numerous terabytes of big datato the point that IT faced a data scalability crisis. Ten we were once again snatched from the jaws of defeat by Moores law. Storage and CPUs not only developed greater capacity, speed, and intelligence; they also fell in price. Enterprises went from being unable to afford or manage big data to lavishing budgets on its collection and analysis. Today, enterprises are exploring big data to discover facts they didnt know before. Tis is an important task right now because the recent economic recession forced deep changes into most businesses, especially those that depend on mass consumers. Using advanced analytics, businesses can study big data to understand the current state of the business and track still-evolving aspects such as customer behavior.},

@article{Lohr2012,

Mo Zhou was snapped up by I.B.M. last summer, as a freshly minted Yale M.B.A., to join the technology company’s fast-growing ranks of data consultants. They help businesses make sense of an explosion of data — Web traffic and social network comments, as well as software and sensors that monitor shipments, suppliers and customers — to guide decisions, trim costs and lift sales. “I’ve always had a love of numbers,” says Ms. Zhou, whose job as a data analyst suits her skills. To exploit the data flood, America will need many more like her. A report last year by the McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm, projected that the United States needs 140,000 to 190,000 more workers with “deep analytical” expertise and 1.5 million more data-literate managers, whether retrained or hired.},
